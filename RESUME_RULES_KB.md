# RESUME & WEBSITE CREATION RULES - KNOWLEDGE BASE

## CRITICAL RULE: NEVER FABRICATE INFORMATION

**NEVER make up:**
- Client names (Mayo Clinic, etc.) ❌
- Specific metrics (99.8% uptime, 18+ facilities) ❌
- Awards YOU didn't personally win ❌
- Job titles or responsibilities not verified ❌
- Project details not in source documents ❌

## VERIFIED INFORMATION ONLY

### ✅ CONFIRMED FACTS (from resume/website):

**Sound & Media:**
- Sound Designer for "Cloud Kumo" - Film won Student Academy Award Silver (2016)
- **Important**: The FILM won, NOT Obai personally
- Co-founder, Karazah Channel: 739K+ subscribers, 310M+ views
- Radio Al-Kul: 500K daily listeners (verify this number)
- Spacetoon: Employee 2000-2010 (Sound Engineer/Production)
- SS Media Productions: Founder/Owner
- Mohammed Bin Rashid Arabic Language Award (2019)

**IT & Technology:**
- IT Director/Consultant experience
- Healthcare and education sectors (general, no specific clients unless verified)
- Network architecture, cybersecurity expertise
- 25+ years in technology

**Education:**
- Los Angeles Recording School graduate

**Press Coverage:**
- NPR
- Al Jazeera
- Washington Post
- BBC Arabic
- Gulf News

### ❌ DO NOT CLAIM:

- Personal Academy Award (the film won, not Obai)
- Specific client names unless verified (NO Mayo Clinic unless proven)
- Exact uptime percentages unless verified
- Number of facilities unless verified
- Any partnerships unless documented

## HOW TO HANDLE UNKNOWN INFORMATION:

**Instead of fabricating:**
- Use general terms: "Healthcare facilities" not "Mayo Clinic"
- Use ranges: "Enterprise-level systems" not "99.8% uptime"
- Use verified categories: "IT leadership in healthcare and education" not specific clients
- Ask user for clarification if needed

## ACCURACY CHECKLIST:

Before writing ANY achievement:
1. ✓ Is this in the source resume/website?
2. ✓ Is this verified by the user?
3. ✓ Am I being precise about who won what? (film vs person)
4. ✓ Are the numbers exact from source documents?
5. ✓ If I'm unsure, did I ask rather than assume?

## SOUND DESIGN AWARD - CORRECT PHRASING:

❌ Wrong: "Student Academy Award Winner"
❌ Wrong: "Won Student Academy Award"

✅ Correct: "Sound Designer for Student Academy Award-winning film"
✅ Correct: "Sound design for 'Cloud Kumo' (Student Academy Award - Silver, 2016)"
✅ Correct: "Contributed sound design to Academy Award-winning animation"

## WHEN IN DOUBT:

**ASK THE USER** rather than making assumptions.

Better to have a gap than fabricated information.
